description: " I am Divya Yadav, a 4th-year Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for frontend development and competitive programming. With a solid foundation in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, I have built a variety of projects, including StudyNotion, a single-page application aimed at enhancing study experiences. My keen interest in problem-solving drives me to excel in competitive programming, continuously refining my skills in data structures and algorithms.

Currently, I am preparing for GATE 2025, focusing on Computer Science (CS) and Data Analytics (DA), with an aspiration to secure full marks and explore PSU opportunities afterward. Alongside my technical pursuits, I am also exploring the intersection of online and offline retail experiences, with an aim to develop a recommendation system that incorporates dynamic features like a reel section, trending creators, and virtual try-on.

I believe in continuous learning and strive to combine creativity with technology to build efficient and user-friendly solutions."
